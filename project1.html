            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Time Travel Adventure</strong> is an immersive narrative-driven game where players experience different historical periods through time travel. The game was built using Unity, and it features dynamic environments, a detailed story, and complex gameplay mechanics involving time-based puzzles.</p>
            <p>As the protagonist, you will explore ancient civilizations, future dystopias, and alternate versions of the world, solving puzzles to manipulate time and prevent a catastrophic event. The game showcases advanced physics, shaders, and a unique time travel mechanic that impacts the gameplay and narrative.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Time travel mechanic that allows players to jump between multiple time periods.</li>
                <li>Rich, detailed environments, each with its own history and narrative.</li>
                <li>Complex AI behavior and puzzle-solving that alters the gameâ€™s world dynamically.</li>
                <li>Original soundtrack and sound design, adding depth to the atmosphere of each time period.</li>
                <li>Branching narrative paths based on player choices, leading to multiple possible endings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unity</strong> - Primary game engine for development.</li>
                <li><strong>C#</strong> - Programming language for game mechanics and systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom Shaders</strong> - For time-based effects and visual transitions between time periods.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Pathfinding</strong> - Using Unity's NavMesh for enemy AI behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Physics Simulations</strong> - Advanced physics systems for interacting with time and environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
            <p>During the development of Time Travel Adventure, I faced several challenges, particularly with the time travel mechanic. Ensuring smooth transitions between different time periods while maintaining a consistent player experience was difficult. To overcome this, I developed custom shaders that allowed seamless transitions between worlds, and implemented a time-based event system that dynamically altered the environment.</p>

            <h3>Play the Game</h3>
